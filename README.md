## MapReduce

This code mimics the process of MapReduce task. Specifically, I have written my own map and reduce functions (without distributing to several machines) to mimic the process of mapper and reducer. The task is to count the number of occurrences of each word in a text file. This program, known as Word Count, is the equivalent of the standard “Hello, world!” program you typically write when you learn a new programming language.

## Dataset
The input of this is a text document (The book Pride and Prejudice - around 13,000 lines) which includes several paragraphs. It is a raw data. You need to do some data cleaning works to prepare it for the next step.
